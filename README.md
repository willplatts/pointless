## About

pointless is a Qt implementation of the ["Pointless" gameshow that airs on British TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointless). I made this to run a game at a youth club, you will also need to find some pointless style questions and the number of people who got them right (or just make it up). I found some questions [here](http://pointlessarchive.blogspot.co.uk/).

## Use

The application has 2 windows: 1 "control" window and 1 "display" window. It is best to use a projector or 2 monitors, so you can show the players the "display" window whilst keeping the control window hidden. Depending on the answer they give, enter the score in the control window and press "Run". The display window will indicate the score to the players. If they get an answer wrong, they get 100 points. If you enter 100 as the score, the display window will indicate a wrong answer.
